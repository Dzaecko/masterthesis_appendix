These spoofed messages cause the Junos OS General Authentication Service (authd) daemon to force the broadband subscriber into this \"Terminating\" state which the subscriber will not recover from thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS) to the endpoint device.

To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would already need to have developer or super user level permissions in Winter CMS. This means they would already have extensive access and control within the system. Additionally, to execute the XSS, the attacker would need to convince the victim to directly visit the URL of the maliciously uploaded SVG, and the application would have to be using local storage where uploaded files are served under the same domain as the application itself instead of a CDN. This is because all SVGs in Winter CMS are rendered through an `img` tag, which prevents any payloads from being executed directly.
